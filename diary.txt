initially two classes - read and write
  Now query , search and display, json methods and Handler

    This is so that easier communication and readability

initially single widget for searching but discovered containers
  allows for widgets to work in unison

    Makes is easier for the user to understand whats going on

drop box display none rather than have no drop box because it shows
    repeatability (basically its teh same format to not confuse users)
