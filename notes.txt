why some ideas are better and some arent
eg graph -- is it useful

INTERVIEW :

What would you call them --- "query" or assets
      the tab names

Configure around yellow pages? and asset catalogue?

How should i interact with seek, login system? presentation? search function? browse ??

Steps?

Set the scope, what do you do, what type of interface / Features


What are your requirements?
Top 20 ask of the seek?
Alice and Bob stories
Persona does he think for interacting
  lab manager
  student
  researcher
  etc

How long is an acceptable wait time?
What are your priorities ?
Moscw

How to present results?
How to deal with permissions?
Boundary of interaction between notebook and seek. What is too much?
I should be able to see permissions, login system , Maybe set permissions?


mark evaluation based on requirements and mosocow
  fufill requiremenets
  reinterview to get responses
  scale respones 1 -5
  feedback form

testing
  did i test ?
  not necessarily have to write my own tests


spiral methodology
  learn , improve, leearn ,make ,test ,etc

  table of my project vs api


Use it for projects, get samples , computational
Log of actions, metadata such as when it was created okay

Automatically create working documents - autofill
everything possible via seek - templates
 with sharing permissons

search for a particular dataset via type
get all items from dataset

scope searching within projects
bugs

sequencing data get me all the data sets ,
breaking objects down from a search time
create things within the API

create files without uploading data

use it for a local seek

priorities :
    search
    ability to do it via command line
    option to use widgits or not
    programmable settings

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

need to surface the type of the data file into the api itself --- requests
  in report, how hard is this? ask stuart

mention why i moscowd jaspers requiremenets
rethink - and write what happened
    hack such as do something else

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

testing - did it do it in time / etc does it work /

feedback - jasper what did i learn etc - formative evaluation agile method
  evaluated with external users with feedback
  another user with more feedback

set up tests - test suites / manual testing
manual testing - depth and coverage - have a collection of what i did
spend more time capabilities and testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
munazah next user
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
demo -
one tab of fairdom , sandbox and Jupyter
create stuff for sandbox
use notebook to display capabilities
upload a notebook

  write up
    build channel between seek and jupyter
      jobs
        find
        write
          new version / new?
          where to put in ISA
          can i take things out and put back in
  story board - of what i will display in demo , works as example for the write up
  eval

search names - localised and whole of the seek
  question for munazah
    local --> global and vice versa
    is it confusing?
    is it ok?
    is it useful
    what do i make searches on ?
    identify tasks i would do?

  did a bit of everything
    what i stubbed
  road map of what i will do eg search the profile of people from query and search


  search button for query
  better names for tabs eg get data, researcher name

autocollapse output
assuming people know structure, its ok


ask finn : works with workflow hub , using the seek as the platform
          scripts instead of data files
          like fairdom but with workflow

jupyter statelesss
dealing with erros
how stuff is formatted
what the project is , waht i did, what i expect ,


finn :
    add template for uploading data ,
        eg if someone wants to upload assay, but investigation and study
        doesnt exist, then make the queries associated
    remove empty tabs
    may have issue uploading jupyter notebooks -- ALAN, issue may be fixed, may not be











What did i use
what is the api like - its changing
What fairdom is and what seek is
Why is this project not trivial
get across that the project includes real users with feedback
Have structure in the demo
  beginning middle end
gk decides what comes in and out what items are allowed to be visible
  stop people seeing things before they are published
hk tidying and cleaning curating

demonstrate private and public functionality
  requires login and permissions

monolithic

Begin
what is Fairdom seek

how to use via browser
all the feedback and user requests

display demo

what i am going to do in the future

real eu product - going into several projects using seek
user base
testing
technologys used
struggles
compared to other similar products before i started working on it
what cons were there

What does the project require me to learn

what is the project about, what will he see

A script on what i am covering from beginning to end
Be direct - I am going
            We will do this bit and then this bit
            Be firm
            Explain everything
            This is my learning outcomes
              challenging -- what was
              organisiation
            Make a difference between simple and simple to use
            vibe of a jupyter notebook
            good interaction
            converted complex json to clear and seperated out information
              scalability
              edge cases
            two user communities
              widgety bit and command line bit
              functionality is there for displaying / finding and putting info
                my job is not editing data files
                Not my job to run model in notebook

          diagram showing refactoring stages
